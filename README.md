## C# (new languages):
The programming languages have many similarities, I can transfer python and objective-c to C#. To do that, I need to learn:
* By reading documentation and tutorials, go through the environment, programming structure, basic syntax, libraries and logic of C#. Compare C# with Python and summary the different patterns. For example, in C#, for/foreach loop syntax is different with for loops in Python.
* Learn basic and advanced features of C#, such as delegates, unsafe codes etc.
* Learn how to use C# implement the Object Oriented Programming concepts, MVC(Model - View - Controller) architecture, unit test etc. Learn how modules are designed, how two or more modules are made to exchange information and how to use an existing module. 
* Learn common libraries in C# and know what the libraries provides, what they are all about? How to apply them in different cases. Especially the ones relate to the FishNet2. For instance, how to connect with database(CRUD operations and Full Text Indexing), web services(HTTP handlers), threads, data processing etc.
* Read FishNet2 code, summary the structure and workflow of FishNet2 project.
* Read lots of good code from Internet, Keep practicing.

/*6. keep up-to-date, know the deeper knowledage of C#(like the life cycle, implementation mode 底层机制，内存调用)always read official documentation(deeply,vertically) knowledage accumulation.*/

## ASP.NET & IIS( or other web frameworks and server software):
### ASP.NET is a web technology for developing web application using C#.
I need to know how to create web application in MVC architecture.
I already know things like URL Handling, routing, templating, AJAX, authentication, sessions, cookies, caching. I need to learn how to implement those functions in ASP.NET. 
### IIS
I have expererience of Apache2 at Linux/Unix, I can transfer Apache2 to IIS.
IIS has GUI, this is an advantagse. What i need to learn are:
How to create and maintain websites. 
How to optimize IIS performance.

## Database(sql server and geo server)
## Openlayer and Flask
