# StudyPlan for FishNet2 and Hydroclim

## C# (new languages)(5 days):
The programming languages have many similarities, I can transfer python and objective-c to C#. To do that, I need to learn:
* By reading documentation and tutorials, go through the environment, programming structure, basic syntax, libraries and logic of C#. Compare C# with Python and summary the different patterns. For example, in C#, for/foreach loop syntax is different with for loops in Python.
* Learn basic and advanced features of C#, such as delegates, unsafe codes etc.
* Learn how to use C# implement the Object Oriented Programming concepts, MVC(Model - View - Controller) architecture, unit test etc. Learn how modules are designed, how two or more modules are made to exchange information and how to use an existing module. 
* Learn common libraries in C# and know what the libraries provide, what they are all about? How to apply them in different cases. Especially the ones relate to the FishNet2. For instance, how to connect with database(CRUD operations and Full Text Indexing), web services(HTTP handlers), threads, data processing etc.
* Read lots of good code from the Internet, Keep practicing.

## ASP.NET & IIS( or other web frameworks and server software)(5 days):
### ASP.NET
ASP.NET is a web technology for developing a web application using C#. I already know how to implement MVC in Angular6. And I also have some ASP.NET experience before. What I need to know to transfer to ASP.NET are:
* How to create a web application with MVC architecture.
* How to implement URL Handling, routing, templating, AJAX, authentication, sessions, cookies, caching and the other functions in ASP.NET. 
* Read FishNet2 code, summary the structure and workflow of FishNet2 project.

### IIS
IIS is an extensible web server. I have experience with Apache2, I can transfer Apache2 to IIS. IIS has GUI, this is an advantage. What I need to learn are:
* How to create and maintain websites. 
* How to optimize IIS performance.

## Database(SQL server and Full Index searching)(3 days)
 I learned database using SQL server when I was undergraduate. Now I need to transfer PostgreSQL to SQL server. What I should learn are:
* Basic SQL. It covers select and where clauses, case expressions, unions, and a few other odds and ends.
* Joins, subqueries, modifying data, Aggregation, Date, Recursive etc.
* Indexing and Stored Procedures
* Database Management in SQL server
* The most important part is spatial and full index searching, I already know their concepts and principles. I have to learn how they are work in SQL server. *A quick question: Why does FishNet2 not use Solr/Lucene here*

## IPT
I have installed IPT and import sample data before by following the video tutorial on GBIF website. What I need to learn are:
* Familiar with the Darwin Core Archives format and components.
* Publish the Darwin Core Archives data using IPT.
* Familiar with the data format and content of sourcedata colleceted by TUBRI.

## GeoServer + Openlayer (10 days)
GeoServer is totally new for me. I am not sure how deeply I need to learn. I was starting to read the documentation. I installed a server on my computer and tried to operate and generate map data and files. Then I make Openlayer connect with GeoServer to load map files and data to present a map in a webpage.
Openlayer 2.x and Openlayer 4.x may have different usages and features. A summary is important.
If you can provide some guides, advice, and training, the learning process could be more efficient. 
## Flask (10 days)
It is a web framework written in Python. I think it is similar to Django. What I need to learn are:
* Read the documentation and learn how to create web applications with MVC architecture.
* How to implement database CRUD operation, HTTP handling, URL Handling, routing, templating, sessions, cookies and the other functions in Flask.
