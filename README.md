## C# (new languages)(5 days):
The programming languages have many similarities, I can transfer python and objective-c to C#. To do that, I need to learn:
* By reading documentation and tutorials, go through the environment, programming structure, basic syntax, libraries and logic of C#. Compare C# with Python and summary the different patterns. For example, in C#, for/foreach loop syntax is different with for loops in Python.
* Learn basic and advanced features of C#, such as delegates, unsafe codes etc.
* Learn how to use C# implement the Object Oriented Programming concepts, MVC(Model - View - Controller) architecture, unit test etc. Learn how modules are designed, how two or more modules are made to exchange information and how to use an existing module. 
* Learn common libraries in C# and know what the libraries provide, what they are all about? How to apply them in different cases. Especially the ones relate to the FishNet2. For instance, how to connect with database(CRUD operations and Full Text Indexing), web services(HTTP handlers), threads, data processing etc.
* Read lots of good code from the Internet, Keep practicing.

/*6. keep up-to-date, know the deeper knowledage of C#(like the life cycle, implementation mode 底层机制，内存调用)always read official documentation(deeply,vertically) knowledage accumulation.*/

## ASP.NET & IIS( or other web frameworks and server software)(5 days):
### ASP.NET is a web technology for developing web application using C#. I already know how to implement MVC in Angular6. And I also have some ASP.NET experience before. What I need to know to tranfer to ASP.NET are:
* How to create web application with MVC architecture.
* How to implement URL Handling, routing, templating, AJAX, authentication, sessions, cookies, caching and the other functions in ASP.NET. 
* Read FishNet2 code, summary the structure and workflow of FishNet2 project.

### IIS is an extensible web server. I have expererience of Apache2, I can transfer Apache2 to IIS. IIS has GUI, this is an advantage. What i need to learn are:
* How to create and maintain websites. 
* How to optimize IIS performance.

## Database(SQL server and Full Index searching)(4 days)
# I learned database using SQL server when I was undergraduate. Now I need to transfer PostgreSQL to SQL server. What I should learn are:
* Baisc SQL. It covers select and where clauses, case expressions, unions, and a few other odds and ends.
* Joins, subqueries, modifying data, Aggregation, Date, Recursive etc.
* Indexing and Stored Procedures
* Database Management in SQL server
* The most important part is spatial and full index searching, I already know their concepts and principles. I have to learn how they are work in SQL server. *A quick question: Why does FishNet2 not use Solr/lucene here*
# In summary


# GeoServer
## GeoServer is totally new for me. I am not sure what 
## Openlayer and Flask
